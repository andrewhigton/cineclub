# Saturday Cinema Club #

 


 ## Description ## 

An app for crowd-funded cinema, where users create a film or screening, post it on the website, share on social media for friends, where they and other users can buy tickets. Once the screening reaches a certain number, the screening is booked at the cinema and all ticket buyers are booked in.          

The idea comes from Saturday afternoons at the cinema as a child, and the opportunity to see older films on the big screen that rarely appear in cinemas now      

I built it using React, Redux, Express, MongoDB, Stripe and Typescript 

Other features I aim to add include:

* An expiry date for films
* A delete tickets button
* A dropdown feature to select different cinemas
* Fully tested


## How to run: ##

* git clone
* npm install
* npm run dev

Log in with an example account to see booked tickets, created films etc:
